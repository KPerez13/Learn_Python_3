# Task 1:
# We have provided you with two lists, letters and points. We would like to combine these two into a dictionary that would map a letter to its point value.

# Using a list comprehension and zip, create a dictionary called letter_to_points that has the elements of letters as the keys and the elements of points as the values.

letter_to_points = {letter: point for letter, point in zip(letters, points)}

print(letter_to_points)

# Task 2:
# Our letters list did not take into account blank tiles. Add an element to the letter_to_points dictionary that has a key of " " and a point value of 0.

letter_to_points[" "] = 0


## Building out the function Tasks

# # Task 3:
# # We want to create a function that will take in a word and return how many points that word is worth.

# # Define a function called score_word that takes in a parameter word.

# # Task 4
# Inside score_word, create a variable called point_total and set it to 0.

# # Task 5
# After defining point_total, create a for loop that goes through the letters in word and adds the point value of each letter to point_total.

# You should get the point value from the letter_to_points dictionary. If the letter you are checking for is not in letter_to_points, add 0 to the point_total.

# # Task 6
# After the for loop is finished, return point_total.

# # Task 7
# Let’s test this function! Create a variable called brownie_points and set it equal to the value returned by the score_word() function with an input of "BROWNIE".

# # Task 8 
# We expect the word BROWNIE to earn 15 points:

# (B + R + O + W + N + I + E)

# (3 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 + 1 + 1) = 15

# Task 9
# Create a dictionary called player_to_words that maps players to a list of the words they have played. This table represents the data to transcribe into your dictionary:
# player1 	wordNerd 	Lexi Con 	Prof Reader
# BLUE 	EARTH 	ERASER 	ZAP
# TENNIS 	EYES 	BELLY 	COMA
# EXIT 	MACHINE 	HUSKY 	PERIOD

# Task 10
# Create an empty dictionary called player_to_points.

player_to_points = {}

# Task 11
# Iterate through the items in player_to_words. Call each player player and each list of words words.

# Within your loop, create a variable called player_points and set it to 0.

# Task 12
# Within the loop, create another loop that goes through each word in words and adds the value of score_word() with word as an input.

# Task 13(only move on once you've completed Task 12)
# After the inner loop ends, set the current player value to be a key of player_to_points, with a value of player_points.

# Task 14(After task 13 was complete)
# player_to_points should now contain the mapping of players to how many points they’ve scored. Print this out to see the current standings for this game!

# If you’ve calculated correctly, wordNerd should be winning by 1 point.
