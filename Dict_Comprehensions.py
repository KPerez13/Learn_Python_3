# Creating Dictionaries
# Dict Comprehensions

# Letâ€™s say we have two

# lists
# that we want to combine into a dictionary, like a list of students and a list of their heights, in inches:

# names = ['Jenny', 'Alexus', 'Sam', 'Grace']
# heights = [61, 70, 67, 64]

# Copy to Clipboard

# Python allows you to create a dictionary using a dict comprehension, with this syntax:

# students = {key:value for key, value in zip(names, heights)}
# #students is now {'Jenny': 61, 'Alexus': 70, 'Sam': 67, 'Grace': 64}

# Copy to Clipboard

# Remember that

# zip()
# combines two lists into an iterator of

# tuples
# with the list elements paired together. This dict comprehension:

#     Takes a pair from the iterator of tuples
#     Names the elements in the pair key (the one originally from the names list) and value (the one originally from the heights list)
#     Creates a key : value item in the students dictionary
#     Repeats steps 1-3 for the entire iterator of pairs

# Instruction #1:
# You have two lists, representing some drinks sold at a coffee shop and the milligrams of caffeine in each. First, create a variable called zipped_drinks that is an iterator of pairs between the drinks list and the caffeine list.


drinks = ["espresso", "chai", "decaf", "drip"]
caffeine = [64, 40, 0, 120]

zipped_drinks = zip(drinks,caffeine)

# Instruction #2:
# Create a dictionary called drinks_to_caffeine by using a dict comprehension that goes through the zipped_drinks iterator and turns each tuple pair into a key:value item.

drinks_to_caffeine = {drinks:caffeine for drinks, caffeine in zip(drinks,caffeine)}
