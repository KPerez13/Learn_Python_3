# Empty Dictionary
# <1 min

# A dictionary doesnâ€™t have to contain anything. Sometimes we need to create an empty dictionary when we plan to fill it later based on some other input.

# We can create an empty dictionary like this:

# empty_dict = {}

# Copy to Clipboard

# We will explore ways to fill a dictionary in the next exercise.

# Instruction #1:
# Create an empty dictionary called my_empty_dictionary.

my_empty_dictionary = {}
