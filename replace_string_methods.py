# .replace()
# . Replace takes two arguments and replaces all instances of the first argument in a string with the second argument. The syntax is as follows

# string_name.replace(substring_being_replaced, new_substring)

# Great! Letâ€™s put it in context and look at an example.

# with_spaces = "You got the kind of loving that can be so smooth"
# with_underscores = with_spaces.replace(' ', '_')
# print(with_underscores)
# # 'You_got_the_kind_of_loving_that_can_be_so_smooth'

# Here we used .replace() to change every instance of a space in the string above to be an underscore instead.

# Note that in this example, we used a single character, but these

# can be multiple characters long!

# Use .replace() to change all instances of Tomer in the bio to Toomer. Save the updated bio to the string toomer_bio_fixed.
